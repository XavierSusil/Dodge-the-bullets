This is simple 2d character based  game  developed  in c++ console
   In this  project  I  tried to  create a  unicode character based  game  using  c++. This  was done in  microsoft visual studio 2022.
   This  is  still not  completed.  As of now   some  basic   functionalities has been added  and there  are  little  more to come. 
   This    is a fun project  implemented only  for  learning purpose.
